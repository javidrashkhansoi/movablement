# Code of Conduct â€“ movablement

Hi! I am developing **movablement** on my own, but I am open to discussions and possible contributions in the future. To keep interactions positive, I suggest following a few simple principles:


## 1. Kindness and Respect

- Let's communicate politely and constructively.
- No hate, insults, or toxic behavior.


## 2. Constructive Discussions

- Criticism is welcome, but make it useful.
- If you suggest changes, please explain why they are needed.


## 3. No Spam or Harmful Actions

- Do not create useless **issues** or **pull requests**.
- Do not attempt to intentionally break the project.


## 4. Handling Conflicts and Violations

If issues arise, I reserve the right to:
- Ignore destructive comments.
- Close unhelpful discussions.
- Block users if necessary.


This project is open for exploration and possibly future collaboration. Thank you for being respectful!
